# DESCRIPTION

This module contains a set of filters for converting
[mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) style markdown documentation into a single
[pandoc(1)](http://www.pandoc.org) flavoured markdown document. This is useful
for

* Generating PDF or EPUB from your mkdocs documentation
* Generating single-page HTML from your mkdocs documentation
* Converting your mkdocs documentation to other formats, such as asciidoc.

Aside from the filters the module contains a converter class tying them
together into a coherent whole and the command line converter `mkdocs2pandoc`.

# PREREQUISITES

For generating PDF through pandoc(1) you will need to install a few things
pip(1) won't handle, namely pandoc and the somewhat exotic LaTeX packages its
default LaTeX template uses. On a Ubuntu 14.04 system this amounts to the
following packages:

```
fonts-lmodern
lmodern
pandoc
texlive-base
texlive-latex-extra
texlive-fonts-recommended
texlive-latex-recommended
texlive-xetex
```

# INSTALLATION

Make sure, you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed, then issue
the following command:

```
pip install mkdocs-pandoc
```

This will install the stable version. If you'd like to use the development
version, use

```
pip install https://github.com/jgrassler/mkdocs_pandoc
```

instead.

# USAGE

When executed in the directory where your documentation's `mkdoc.yml` and the
`docs/` directory containing the actual documentation resides, `mkdocs2pandoc`
should print one long Markdown document suitable for `pandoc(1)` on standard
output. This works under the following assumptions:

## Usage example

```
cd ~/mydocs
mkdocs2pandoc > mydocs.pd
pandoc --toc -f markdown+grid_tables+table_captions -o mydocs.pdf mydocs.pd   # Generate PDF
pandoc --toc -f markdown+grid_tables -t epub -o mydocs.epub mydocs.pd         # Generate EPUB
```

# BUGS

The following things are known to be broken:

* `mdtableconv.py`: Line wrapping in table cells will wrap links, which causes
  whitespace to be inserted in their target URLs, at least in PDF output. While
  this is a bit of a Pandoc problem, it can and should be fixed in this module.

* [Internal Hyperlinks](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#internal-hyperlinks) 
  between markdown documents will be reduced to their link titles, i.e. they
  will not be links in the resulting Pandoc document.
